This C program implements a Smart Parking System that manages vehicle parking, tracks parking fees, and assigns memberships based on total parking hours. The system includes the following features:

Vehicle Registration & Parking: Vehicles can be registered and assigned parking spaces based on their membership level (Gold, Premium, or None).

Parking Space Management: The system keeps track of available parking spots and assigns them according to priority (Gold → Premium → None).

Fee Calculation & Membership Upgrades: Parking fees are calculated based on time spent, with discounts for members. Vehicles can be upgraded to Premium or Gold membership based on accumulated parking hours.

Sorting & Reporting: The system can sort and display vehicles by total parkings, total amount paid, and parking spaces by occupancy and revenue generated.


This program efficiently manages parking lot operations and provides useful insights into parking space utilization.
